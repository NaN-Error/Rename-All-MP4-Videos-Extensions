A Tkinter GUI application that organizes files by renaming or moving them based on user selections. Users choose a root folder, and the app processes each folder and subfolder, renaming files to ".mp4" or hiding ".mp4" extensions as specified. It ensures folders are created as needed and provides feedback on successful organization.
